TODO's: in client.js 
Line 22 - I would like to improve the code so that the whole shape toggle can be done in one function and not in 3 to clean up the code.
Line 56 - I would like to shorten the code so that the four pictures are not included in every option. If there were more images and options, this would get even more clutteres. If the code can be improved so that it doesn't have to go through each image and option every time, it would also speed up the whole function.

Above and Beyond:
I added a couple animations for fun but I am not sure if they would count for the above and beyond. They were some transitions for the header at line 28 of main.css. I also included some transitions to the shapes when they are turned back on at lines 90, 101 and 111.

I also styled the range sliders and the styling can be found at lines 31-53 of main.css. The sliders are styled differently with different browsers so this one will be styled for Firefox.
